Explore California has decided that they're going to take up the cause of a particular senate bill, here referred to as Senate Bill XYZABC. So they want to get the word out, and they want people to write to their representatives. And so they're offering this little app to let people put in their zip code and find out who their senators are. This is a great example where being able to call out for an external API, get some data on who their senators are, and bring it back into our own page without having to send them elsewhere is useful.
